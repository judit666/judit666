### Hi, I'm Judit 👩‍💻👋

🏠 began with a BSc in Business Information Technology at Corvinus University of Budapest between 2016-2020\
⚡ finished [MSc in Data Science at University of Amsterdam][website] in July, 2021\
🧠 became a data scientist\
🔭 currently working on my toy projects

I worked as a data analyst intern at Deloitte, then as a data scientist intern at a spanish company called Passnfly then concluded my MSc thesis as a machine learning engineer intern. I always enjoyed working on real-life data projects and now I would like to utilize my skills to start my first full-time job as a data scientist. I believe that product data science would be my ideal role, where I could both communicate with stakeholders and other people in the data team as well.
